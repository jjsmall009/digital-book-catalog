# digital-home-library

This is the project I'm going to work on over winter break 2015.  It will be a Windows application 
that will allow users to create a digital collection of the books they have.  They'll be able to add
books based off of the title or author name, and it will intelligently grab data from Amazon or 
Wikipedia perhaps and gather the rest of the book data for you.

I'm thinking of programming it in Java using SQLite as the database backend, and I'm still trying to 
decide how to do the interface.  Guess it's time to start planning and designing.  

*(Note: this readme is a working copy.  I will update it as I develop the application.)*
