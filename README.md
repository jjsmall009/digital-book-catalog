# digital-book-catalog

This is the project I'm going to work on over winter break 2015.  It will be a Windows application
that will allow users to create a digital collection of the books they have.  They'll be able to add
books based off of the title or author name, and it will intelligently grab data from Amazon or
Wikipedia perhaps and gather the rest of the book data for you.

I'm thinking of programming it in Java using SQLite as the database backend, and I'm still trying to
decide how to do the interface.  Guess it's time to start planning and designing.  

### Update for 12/12/15
I've decided to take different approach to designing this project.  Instead of jumping head first into
both creating the back end logic stuff and working on the JavaFX UI design, I'm going to do an iterative
approach and design it in three stages.
1.  Console view only.
2.  Console view only with the SQLite database backend
3.  GUI version using JavaFX

This will make things a bit easier and will expedite the development process.
